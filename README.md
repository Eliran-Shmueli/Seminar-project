### <div align="center">Seminar Project</div>  
  

The main objective of this project was to program a game with a server side and a client side in Python, <b>that supports multiple clients</b>.  
  

For the project I selected the game "hand rock paper scissors", because of his known rules.  
  

Using GUI, Object-Oriented Programming and libreries such as pygame and matplotlib, I programed the server side and the client side.

<br/>  

The server main screen - on this screen we can connect and disconnect users, we can also see who is connected at that moment.

<br />
On the server, we can view information about the games that have been played and information about the players.
